Loss of interest in sex",herbal,,,"5-Hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) is decarboxylated ""in vivo"" to yield serotonin, a neuro-hormonal transmitter released by neurons in the brain, spinal cord and symphatetic ganglia. Its seed contains active drug 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). 5HTP is an aromatic amino acid naturally produced by the body from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan. Produced commercially by extraction from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia. 

Valerian extract is effective in treating mild-to-moderate sleeping disorders without adverse effects on REM sleep and without significant hangover effects. Valerian has a sedative-hypnotics, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant and antispasmodic effects. 

5HTP acts primarily by within the centralesing levels of serotonin nervous system. Other neurotransmitters and CNS chemicals, such as melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and beta endorphin have also been shown to increase following oral administration of 5HTP. 

Valepotriate binds to dopamine receptors. Valerenic acid also appears to inhibit the enzyme system responsible for the central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activities. 

Valerian extracts containing amino acids and valerenic acid bind with the GABA-A receptor. In the brain cortex. 

Extract of Valerian inhibits the uptake and stimulates the release of GABA, leading to increase concentration of GABA in synaptic clefts. Valerenic acid may increasing inhibit enzymes that break down GABA, thus GABA levels and producing CNS-depressing effect.","5HTP is indicated in-

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Acme's Acme's Spirulina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

It may cause diarrhoea, bronchospasm, palpitation & precipitation of asthma.

One hundred patients of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) with various disabilities were studied to see the effects of Areca Catechu. Fifty patients (interventions) were given Areca Catechu and fifty other patients (control) 
were treated with the conventional vasodilators. The male-female ratio was 4:1. As usual physiotherapy was given to both group of patients. The result of the treatment showed that unconscious patients regained consciousness and the dysphasic patients started speaking much earlier than those of the control group. The improvement in the activity of daily living and recovery of micturition control were earlier. The Areca Catechu was also useful in patients with chronic CVD due to atherosclerosis. 

The probable mode of action of Areca catechu on CVD patients may be presumed as follows : by improving circulation of the brain, by direct stimulating of the brain cell, by improving metabolism and nutrition of the brain cells, by the combination of the above mechanisms. Arecoline and other alkaloids in the Areca Catechu which are known as parasympathomimetic agents might have improved circulation of the brain by dilating cerebral blood vessels, thereby increasing blood flow. Areca Catechu contains many essential amino acids and other essential nutrients or some unidentified factors which may improve the metabolism of the brain. This may also be due to direct stimulation of the brain by the alkaloids present in Areca Catechu.","Cerebral insufficiency, Stroke, Loss of speech, Unconsciousness, Paralysis, Urinary retention due to cerebral vascular diseases, Nervous debility and Dementia.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Arulina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called ""lipid peroxides"". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase. 

Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes. 

Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)","• Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases(COPD)

The antioxidant activity of silymarin is ten times more powerful than vitamin E. It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer membrane of liver cells. 

Silymarin has also membrane stabilizing effect. It alters the liver membrane cell structure in such a way that certain toxins cannot enter into the cell. Silymarin protects liver cells (hepatocytes) from damage caused by alcohol, organic compounds, viral infections, acetaminophen, environmental pollutants and by products of metabolism including foods, drugs, chemotherapeutic agents and other chemicals.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Bexy-Fort is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Undenatured collagen II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells. 

Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding.

Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions: 

Anti-toxin activity Anti-toxin activity : S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile. 

Anti-microbial Anti-microbial : S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements. 

Enzymatic activity Enzymatic activity : In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules). 

Immune Enhancement Immune Enhancement : S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA. 

Anti-inflammatory Anti-inflammatory : S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Biosac is indicated for the prevention and treatment of following conditions:

The liver-protecting and liver-repairing functions of Silymarin are due to two main actions: antioxidant and protein-restoring activities. The antioxidant activity of silymarin is ten times more powerful than vitamin E. It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer membrane of liver cells. 

Silymarin has also membrane stabilizing effect. It alters the liver membrane cell structure in such a way that certain toxins cannot enter into the cell. Silymarin protects liver cells (hepatocytes) from damage caused by alcohol, organic compounds, viral infections, acetaminophen, environmental pollutants and by products of metabolism including foods, drugs, chemotherapeutic agents and other chemicals.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Brogel is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Undenatured collagen II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells. 

Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding.

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues. 

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces.

The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content.

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Dirulina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Well tolerated in recommended dose. Well tolerated in recommended dose.,herbal,,,"Phylloquinone is often called vitamin K1. Phylloquinone is fat soluble and stable in air and moisture. However, it degrades in sunlight. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants. Vitamin K is needed for the post translational modification of certain proteins, mostly required for blood coagulation. 

Vitamin K2 is necessary for the activation of osteocalcin, a protein that transports and integrates calcium into bone to ensure a healthy skeleton. Incorporating calcium into the bone matrix means that less calcium is available for harmful deposits in soft body tissues. 

Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) is essential for normal bone growth & development and to maintain bone density. It also helps our body to utilize both Calcium & Phosphorus. 

The active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.","DK tablet is indicated in:

It can cause allergic skin rashes in some people.",herbal,,,"The USP refers to Coenzyme Q10 as Ubidecarenone which is a fat-soluble vitamin like substance. It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues. 

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces. The main elimination of Ubidecarenone occurs with bile.","Fertisoft is indicated in

Hyaluronic acid is naturally present throughout the human body. In the joints, hyaluronic acid has several functions, including: 

Lubrication: Hyaluronic acid Lubrication: Hyaluronic acid binds well to water, producing a viscous, jelly-like consistency. This viscous fuid provides lubrication and also acts as a shock absorber within the joint. Growth of cartilage and bone: Hyaluronic acid helps in the growth and development of joint’s cartilage and bone by promoting the growth of new cells and tissues. Reducing infammation: Hyaluronic acid plays an important role in reducing joint infammation and pain caused by injury or tissue degeneration. 

Methylsulfonylmethane Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has anti-infammatory and antioxidant efects. Sulphur, which is a major component of MSM, plays an important role in making collagen and glucosamine, both of which are vital for healthy bones and joints. In clinical study, MSM shows signifcant decrease in WOMAC pain and physical function impairment. 

Turmeric extract Turmeric extract contains curcumin which has anti-infammatory, antithrombotic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The anti-infammatory efects of curcumin are believed to be a result of inhibiting pro-infammatory signals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cyclooxygenase-2. In addition, curcumin has been demonstrated to suppress several pro-infammatory cytokines and mediators of their release such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, and nitric oxide synthase. 

Boswellic acid Boswellic acid is the active ingredient in Boswellia serrata which has signifcant pharmacological activity in the treatment of infammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other infammatory conditions. Research showed that 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), present in Boswellia serrata extract, has a powerful inhibitory efect on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).","This capsule is indicated for-

Andrographis has flavonoids, which always have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that the flavonoid activities suppressed the genetic expression of neutrophils. Similarly, studies have indicated that a variety of inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, are reduced by the presence of Andrographoloid. 

The aerial parts and their constituent andrographolides have antihepato-toxic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of a methanol extract of the aerial parts to mice reduced hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4, and reversed CCl4 induced histopathological changes in the liver. Intraperitoneal administration of andrographolide to mice inhibited the CCl4 induced increase in the activity of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides. Andrographolide, the major antihepatotoxic component of the plant, exerted a pronounced protective effect in rats against hepato-toxicity induced by CCl4, Dgalactosamine, paracetamol and ethanol.

This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus.

Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the several bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus. It gets its name from lacto-meaning milk, bacillus-meaning rod-like in shape and acidophilus-meaning acid-loving. L. acidophilus occurs naturally in a variety of foods, including dairy, grain, meat and fish. It is also present in human (and animal) intestines, mouths and vaginas. These types of healthy bacteria inhabit in the intestines and vaginas and protect against some unhealthy organisms. 

Lactobacillus bulgaricus is one of several bacteria used for the production of yogurt. First identified in 1905 by the Bulgarian doctor Stamen Grigorov, it is named after Bulgaria. Morphologically, it is a gram-positive rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is also non-motile and it does not form spores. The bacterium feeds on milk and produces lactic acid which also helps to preserve the milk. It breaks down lactose and is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance, whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars. While fermenting milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, which perfumes yogurt. 

Bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human and animal colon. Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria within days after birth. Bifidobacteria were first isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants. They are gram-positive anaerobes, non-motile, non spore forming and catalase-negative. Their name is derived from the observation that they often exist in a 'Y'-shaped or bifid form. To date 30 species of bifidobacteria have been isolated.",The use of probiotics is not advised in patients at risk of opportunistic infections and in those with badly damaged GI tracts.

Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions: 

Anti-toxin activity Anti-toxin activity : S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile. 

Anti-microbial Anti-microbial : S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements. 

Enzymatic activity Enzymatic activity : In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules). 

Immune Enhancement Immune Enhancement : S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA. 

Anti-inflammatory Anti-inflammatory : S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Goodbac-SB is indicated for the prevention and treatment of following conditions:

It contains active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of Undenatured Type II Collagen interact with Peyer's patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specifc regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specifc regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells which are destructive for joint cartilage. 

It prevents the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of infammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of infammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. 

Hyaluronic acid is naturally present throughout the human body. In the joints, hyaluronic acid has several functions, including: 

Lubrication: Hyaluronic acid Lubrication: Hyaluronic acid binds well to water, producing a viscous, jelly-like consistency. This viscous fuid provides lubrication and also acts as a shock absorber within the joint. Growth of cartilage and bone: Hyaluronic acid helps in the growth and development of joint’s cartilage and bone by promoting the growth of new cells and tissues. Reducing infammation: Hyaluronic acid plays an important role in reducing joint infammation and pain caused by injury or tissue degeneration. 

Methylsulfonylmethane Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has anti-infammatory and antioxidant efects. Sulphur, which is a major component of MSM, plays an important role in making collagen and glucosamine, both of which are vital for healthy bones and joints. In clinical study, MSM shows signifcant decrease in WOMAC pain and physical function impairment. 

Turmeric extract Turmeric extract contains curcumin which has anti-infammatory, antithrombotic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The anti-infammatory efects of curcumin are believed to be a result of inhibiting pro-infammatory signals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cyclooxygenase-2. In addition, curcumin has been demonstrated to suppress several pro-infammatory cytokines and mediators of their release such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, and nitric oxide synthase. 

Boswellic acid Boswellic acid is the active ingredient in Boswellia serrata which has signifcant pharmacological activity in the treatment of infammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other infammatory conditions. Research showed that 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), present in Boswellia serrata extract, has a powerful inhibitory efect on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX).","This capsule is indicated for-

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Immuna is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Silymarin stimulates RNA polymerase-A, enhances protein synthesis and helps to regenerate and repair liver cell. 

The liver-protecting and liver-repairing functions of Silymarin are due to two main actions: antioxidant and protein-restoring activities. The antioxidant activity of silymarin is ten times more powerful than vitamin E. It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer membrane of liver cells.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Lina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Andrographis has flavonoids, which always have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that the flavonoid activities suppressed the genetic expression of neutrophils. Similarly, studies have indicated that a variety of inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, are reduced by the presence of Andrographoloid. 

The aerial parts and their constituent andrographolides have antihepato-toxic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of a methanol extract of the aerial parts to mice reduced hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4, and reversed CCl4 induced histopathological changes in the liver. Intraperitoneal administration of andrographolide to mice inhibited the CCl4 induced increase in the activity of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides. Andrographolide, the major antihepatotoxic component of the plant, exerted a pronounced protective effect in rats against hepato-toxicity induced by CCl4, Dgalactosamine, paracetamol and ethanol.

They are major constitutes of macular pigment, a compound concentrated in the macula region of the retina that is responsible for fine- feature vision. Lutein and Zeaxanthin serve important antioxidant functions, including deactivating free radicals and filtering harmful blue light that can otherwise lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the visual system. Lutein and Zeaxanthin protect healthy cells from oxidative stress, inflammation and free radical damage. 

Many electronic devices (mobile, tab etc.) emit significant amounts of high-energy, blue light which can be absorbed by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRCGs), and create localized oxidative stress and damage. Laboratory studies conducted with rats and humans show that extended exposure to blue light can actually accelerate rates of retinal cell death, inhibit melatonin, and lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle. 

Lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to combat light-induced damage by absorbing incoming wavelengths of damaging light before they can form reactive oxygen species. Lutein and Zeaxanthin can help protect retinal cells by physically and chemically ""quenching"" these unstable molecules. 

Lutein and Zeaxanthin in the form of nutritional supplements can also improve children's carotenoid status.

Ames testing has demonstrated an absence of any mutagenic effects for purified Lutein and Zeaxanthin.",herbal,,,"Lutein and Zeaxanthin are two important antioxidants belonging to the class of carotenoids called xanthophyll. They are major constitutes of macular pigment, a compound concentrated in the macula region of the retina that is responsible for fine- feature vision. Lutein and Zeaxanthin serve important antioxidant functions, including deactivating free radicals and filtering harmful blue light that can otherwise lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the visual system. Lutein and Zeaxanthin protect healthy cells from oxidative stress, inflammation and free radical damage. 

Many electronic devices (mobile, tab etc.) emit significant amounts of high-energy, blue light which can be absorbed by the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRCGs), and create localized oxidative stress and damage. Laboratory studies conducted with rats and humans show that extended exposure to blue light can actually accelerate rates of retinal cell death, inhibit melatonin, and lead to disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle. 

Lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to combat light-induced damage by absorbing incoming wavelengths of damaging light before they can form reactive oxygen species. Lutein and Zeaxanthin can help protect retinal cells by physically and chemically ""quenching"" these unstable molecules. 

Lutein and Zeaxanthin in the form of nutritional supplements can also improve children's carotenoid status. Studies show that Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplements are safe for children as young as preterm infants, and can effectively increase plasma levels in infants and children. A number of studies show that, in addition to visual benefits, supplementation with Lutein and Zeaxanthin can enhance cognitive performance during childhood 

In studies conducted with school-aged children (aged 7-10 years), researchers found that children with high macular pigment ocular density (MPOD) made the least errors on a memory task, and performed the best on reading, math, written language, and achievement tests. Conversely, children in these studies with low MPOD (i.e., low levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in their brain) performed less well. Another study of 10 mg Lutein and 2 mg Zeaxanthin for 180 days showed significant increases in serum lutein levels, reduced eye strain (pain, headache) and fatigue, and improved cognitive performance (focus, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory)","20/5 mg capsule is indicated in-

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues. 

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces. The main elimination of Ubidecarenone occurs with bile.","Metazem is indicated in

Fenugreek is an annual plant belongs to the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae). The scientific name of Fenugreek is Trigonella foenum-graecum. 

The antidiabetic properties of Fenugreek seeds are attributed to the active substances they contain, such as Saponins, Diosgenin, 4-Hydroxyisoleucin, Galactomannan and Trigonelline. These substances demonstrate antidiabetic properties of Fenugreek seeds. Fenugreek seeds contain 50% Saponins, which reduce the rate of glucose absorption in the digestive tract. 4-Hydroxyisoleucin stimulates insulin secretion from the paricreas and also decreases insulin resistance. Galactomannan helps in glucose resorption and Trigonelline improves B-cell regeneration.

Silymarin stimulates RNA polymerase-A, enhances protein synthesis and helps to regenerate and repair liver cell. 

The liver-protecting and liver-repairing functions of Silymarin are due to two main actions: antioxidant and protein-restoring activities. The antioxidant activity of silymarin is ten times more powerful than vitamin E. It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer membrane of liver cells. 

Silymarin has also membrane stabilizing effect. It alters the liver membrane cell structure in such a way that certain toxins cannot enter into the cell. Silymarin protects liver cells (hepatocytes) from damage caused by alcohol, organic compounds, viral infections, acetaminophen, environmental pollutants and by products of metabolism including foods, drugs, chemotherapeutic agents and other chemicals. 

It also acts by anti-lipid peroxidative, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, membrane stabilizing, immunomodulatory and liver regenerating mechanisms.","Methicap (Milk thistle) is indicated for the treatment and prevention of-

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Natlina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Navit is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Glutathione is possibly safe when used in doses up to 500 mg daily for up to 2 months. There isn't a lot of information available about its possible side effects.,herbal,,,"It is well known that the gastrointestinal cells, the mitochondria and the efficiency of immune cell function are three major factors in immune function. Glutathione happens to play a role in all three elements. When small intestinal mucosa atrophies, it causes an increase in epithelial permeability and compromised tight junctions, which can lead to translocation of bacteria. This translocation of bacteria is implicated in immune activation and autoimmunity. Studies have shown that this epithelial damage is in part due to the inability to mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS). 

Supplementing with oral glutathione under conditions in which intracellular glutathione status is compromised can restore tissue glutathione and promote ROS metabolism, thereby mitigating tissue atrophy, according to a 2017 study published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology. 

The most commonly discussed role of glutathione is in the protection of the mitochondria from free radical damage during the process of ATP production. Glutathione is the master antioxidant to quench the reacted oxygen species produced as byproducts, allowing ATP production without the damaging impact that can occur in an environment lacking adequate antioxidant capacity. Mitochondrial health plays a crucial role in immune function via its influence on the T-cell surveillance activity, pattern recognition receptor function, and any ATPdependent immune functions. Regarding individual immune cells, decreased glutathione levels in various cells, such as T-lymphocytes, are observed in patients with immune challenges and the decreased glutathione levels are considered to contribute to a compromised immune system. 

The antioxidant properties of glutathione support healthy immune system function. Intracellular GSH plays a key role in the maintenance and regulation of certain immunological functions, including the activation of lymphocytes and functional activity of natural killer (NK) cells. Within three months of 1,000 mg/day 
Setria® glutathione, NK cell cytotoxicity increased more than twofold from baseline.","Glutathione acts as an important antioxidant in your body.

That means it helps combat free radicals, molecules that can damage your body's cells. Glutathione plays a role in many chemical reactions in your body. It also helps detoxify chemicals, including some that your body creates naturally, as well as pollutants and drugs. Your supply of glutathione seems to drop as you get older, possibly because your body can't create as much. Lower glutathione levels seem to go hand-in-hand with poorer health. For instance, lower levels may play a role in many conditions that are more likely to develop in older people. Your glutathione levels may also fall if you have certain conditions, such as: 
• Cancer
• HIV/AIDS
• Type 2 diabetes
• Hepatitis
• Parkinson's disease
Modern lifestyle habits like poor dietary choices, lack of sleep, abundance of stress, exposure to chemicals, and exercise extremes can incur physiologic changes. Our bodies were designed to handle stress, detoxify chemicals and preserve cell function, but when the burden increases, those naturally built-in systems can't keep up with demand. One of the most common physiological changes seen is the depletion of the body’s most powerful antioxidant, reduced glutathione. Glutathione has been termed ""the master antioxidant"" because of its ability to quench free radicals and protect cells from damage. It has long been thought that humans were unable to utilize preformed glutathione, but recent research proves otherwise. Glutathione has a molecular structure that effectively increases glutathione blood levels when taken orally. It is the only supplemental glutathione backed by a recently published human clinical trial that shows significant uptake of this critical nutrient.",https://medex.com.bd/brands/37926/neucel-500-mg-tablet,,,Herbal and Nutraceuticals Herbal and Nutraceuticals,,"Keep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Nutrilina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Side effects are rare and some may feel stomach problems.",herbal,,,"Glucosamine is a naturally occurring amino sugar of cartilage that provides the basic raw material needed by the body to manufacture joint cartilage. Chondroitin is another naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide of cartilage that stimulates cartilage production, inhibits cartilage destroying enzymes, draws fuid to the cells and helps lubricate the joints. Glucosamine and Chondroitin work synergistically together to help stimulate the production and regeneration of connective tissues (e.g., cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, mucous membrane, blood vessels etc.). Undenatured Type II Collagen is derived from chicken sternum cartilage using a patented, low temperature, nonenzymatic manufacturing process that preserves the natural triple helix molecular confguration and its biological activity. Undenatured Type II Collagen molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of Undenatured Type II Collagen interact with Peyer's patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specifc regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specifc regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells which are destructive for joint cartilage. It prevents the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of infammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of infammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and 
promote cartilage rebuilding.","Orthofit is indicated in:

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues. 

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone.

Its reduction of thromboxane B2 formation and erythrocyte hemolysis suggests a membrane stabilizing property that interferes with the activation of phospholipase A2. Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia. 

Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons. 

Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated. 

Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It acts as counter irritant and numbs the nerve endings that inhibit the transmission of pain sensation.","Muscle pain Sprains, strains and sports injuries, headache bruising, fibrositis, neuralgia, pain due to herpes zoster, osteoarthritis Muscle pain Sprains, strains and sports injuries, headache bruising, fibrositis, neuralgia, pain due to herpes zoster, osteoarthritis",https://medex.com.bd/brands/28879/painthol-2540-mg-muscle-rub,"The fresh or dried fruits of different Capsicum species are used medicinally.

• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function.

This effect may account, in part, for the stimulation of IgA responses in infants infected with rotavirus. Lactic acid bacteria, like strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus have also demonstrated antioxidant ability.

The bacterium feeds on milk and produces lactic acid which also helps to preserve the milk. It breaks down lactose and is often helpful to sufferers of lactose intolerance, whose digestive systems lack the enzymes to break down lactose to simpler sugars. While fermenting milk, Lactobacillus bulgaricus produces acetaldehyde, which perfumes yogurt.

Additionally, it works with the body to re establish the microflora, thereby helping to maintain and support healthy immunity, digestion and gut health. It shows the following actions: 

Anti-toxin activity Anti-toxin activity : S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile. 

Anti-microbial Anti-microbial : S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements.

Also there are few reports of allergic reactions to Protinavit containing supplements.",herbal,,,"Spirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Protinavit is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Undenatured collagen II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells. 

Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Undenatured Type II Collagen supports joint function, mobility and flexibilityand  also improves knee extension by up to 10% for better range of motion. It also relieves joint pain due to strenuous exercise.","Radiflex capsule is indicated for-

Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called ""lipid peroxides"". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase. 

Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes. 

Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)","• Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases(COPD)

Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal.

Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Spirubex is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

The antioxidant activity of silymarin is ten times more powerful than vitamin E. It prevents toxic and foreign substances from penetrating into the liver cells by stabilizing the outer membrane of liver cells. 

Silymarin has also membrane stabilizing effect. It alters the liver membrane cell structure in such a way that certain toxins cannot enter into the cell. Silymarin protects liver cells (hepatocytes) from damage caused by alcohol, organic compounds, viral infections, acetaminophen, environmental pollutants and by products of metabolism including foods, drugs, chemotherapeutic agents and other chemicals.

Its reduction of thromboxane B2 formation and erythrocyte hemolysis suggests a membrane stabilizing property that interferes with the activation of phospholipase A2. Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia. 

Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons. 

Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated. 

Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It acts as counter irritant and numbs the nerve endings that inhibit the transmission of pain sensation.","Muscle pain Sprains, strains and sports injuries, headache bruising, fibrositis, neuralgia, pain due to herpes zoster, osteoarthritis Muscle pain Sprains, strains and sports injuries, headache bruising, fibrositis, neuralgia, pain due to herpes zoster, osteoarthritis",https://medex.com.bd/brands/16540/torel-2540-mg-muscle-rub,"The fresh or dried fruits of different Capsicum species are used medicinally.

It is also anti oxidative (inhibits lipid peroxide formation in the liver), and anti-tumoral. It also inhibits prostaglandin. Piperine has been demonstrated to increase serum levels and lengthen the serum half-life of some nutritional substances. Piperine may act as a thermo- nutrient and increase the absorption of certain nutritional substances from the gastrointestinal tract by producing a local thermogenic action. 

The mechanism of Piperine’s anti-inflammatory activity may be accounted, in part, by Piperine’s possible antioxidant activity. There are a few studies suggesting that Piperine may inhibit lipid peroxidation. However Piperine appears to have this activity when administered with other spice bioactives such as capsaicin and curcumin (Turmeric).","• Dyspeptic complaints

Type II collagen, like all collagen, is made up of three chains of amino acids: glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, which is known as a triple helix. Undenatured type II chicken collagen is a nutritional supplement derived from chicken sternum cartilage using a patented, low temperature, non-enzymatic manufacturing process that preserves the natural triple helix molecular configuration and its biological activities. Boswellic acids are the major constituents of the gum derived from the plant Boswellia serrata Roxb. The gum resin comprises of ß-boswellic acids as the main triterpenic acid along with 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids and their acetates. 

Type II collagen acts as an antigen, causing an autoimmune response that stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory cell-signaling proteins called cytokines. Undenatured collagen type II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen type II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen type II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen- specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells. 

Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Undenatured collagen type II supports joint function, mobility and flexibility and also improves knee extension by up to 10% for better range of motion. It also relieves joint pain due to strenuous exercise. Chicken collagen also contains the chondroitin & glucosamine which help in rebuilding cartilage. The resinous part of Boswellia serrata possesses monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetracyclic triterpenic acids and four major pentacyclic triterpenic acids i.e. β-boswellic acid, acetyl-β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid & acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, responsible for inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes.","This is indicated in-

MECHANISM OF ACTION: 
• Inhibits enzymatic cleavage of collagen by the enzymes secreted by leucocytes during Inflammation.
• By inhibiting retinal phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphatase it confers retinal protection.
• Reduces microvascular impairments due to ischemic reperfusion injury, with preservation of endothelium, attenuation of leukocyte adhesion and improvement of capillary perfusion.
• Produces dose dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation and clot retraction.

It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Vital Protein is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

Also there are few reports of allergic reactions to Vitalina containing supplements.",herbal,,,"Spirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate. 

How does it work- 
• About 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.
• Every 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.
• Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.
• Another health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.","Vitalina is used for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hyperglycemia, anemia, allergic rhinitis and to enhance immunity.

It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging. 

As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues. 

Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces.
